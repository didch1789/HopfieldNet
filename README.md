# HopfieldNet
- Brain: Dynamical Systems.
	- How to characterize it?
	- Using functional connection-based Hopfield artificial neural networks. (FCHN)
	- Finding attractors.

> HMM...? It says it lacks explanation of the underlying driving forces due to its descriptive nature. (seems like it's saying it's directly driven from the data, not via computational models)

- Previously...
	- It's not the first approach to model brain dynamics. (Breakspear, 2017), but too many params...
	- Idea of `neuroconnectionism` (Doerig, 2023). This suggests neuroscientists need a research programme that we all can agree on. More emphasis on cognitive fidelity thani biological fidelity. But this makes ANN confined on specific tasks which lacks explanation on spontaneous dynamics.
- Here...
	- FCHN. No training for a task. Inital weights by `activity flow`.
	- Find 4 attractors, which they argue as extrinsic vs. intrinsic.
